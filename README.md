Philosophy

1.	What's block?
This is called a block ,which contains index,transaction time, data, hash, and previous hash information.
2.	What is block chain?
The chain that is created by connecting these blocks to each other is called blockchain. 
3. What does bitcoin or any cryptocurrency have to do with the block chain?
Bitcoin or cryptopara is in essence just a money transfer book. This information is kept in a chain. That makes it safe. Ensures that no transactions can be performed at the same time. we can't create an infinite array. Necessarily has an end.
4.	What makes Bitcoin valuable?
Just like the money used today. People are what make money valuable. What makes bitcoin so valuable to cryptopara is that we are the people again. Because it has so many users, this cryptopara is more valuable than others. In short the blockchain precious we write still needs a lot of users to arrive.

Overview

I'll show you the Blockchain algorithm and the coding. We used the sha-256 algorithm from the hash library. Two libraries are needed to run this code. These are also hashlib and datetime.

Libraries

Hashlib library: the hashlib library is a library that allows us to encrypt our data in different algorithms. Quite easy to use.
Datetime library: the datetime module consists of some classes that provide us with various functions and attributes so that we can perform operations on time, time and dates.


Coding logic

We only need 4 steps for this simple blockchain program. These are the library definitions in order, the creation of the block class, the creation of the blockchain class, and the final step is to show what we have done.
We only need 2 classes. One of them is to create the block structure, the other is to create the blocks that we have created to connect to each other in an encrypted way.
The last step is to suppress all of this. we'll use the print function.
